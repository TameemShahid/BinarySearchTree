# BinarySearchTree
Generic Binary Search Tree Class.
Binary Search Tree is a node based binary tree data structure. The left subtree of the node contain the nodes with the value's less than the current node value and the right subtree contain the nodes with the value's greater than the current node value. 
The data structure is implemented with the concept that no duplicate entries are allowed.
Intended for the use of numeric data (int, float, double) or the data types containing (<,>,==) defination. 
The data structure contains basic Add(inserting an element to the tree), Search and Delete functionalities. 
The ADT have the best time complexity of O(logn) and the worst time complexity of O(n).
